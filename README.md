Projects worked on for the NYU Formula SAE embedded team.
Includes:
1. Workshop using kiCAD software (creating electronics schematic  and modeling pcb)
2. RGB Led software interface for the STM32 microcontroller (uses PWM protocol)
3. Temperature sensor software interface for the STM32 microcontroller (uses I2C protocol)
